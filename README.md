# Idle Breakout Save Generator
Hello! I made this save generator a while ago, and I don't really play coolmath much anymore. I decided to share it to everyone, so here we are!
# How to use the idle breakout save generator
To use this generator, you either need to follow these steps or go to https://replit.com/@GageKota/SeaSalt-Idle-Breakout-Save-Generator and click the play button, and follow the instructions from there.

# Step one
*THIS IS FOR WINDOWS USERS ONLY, USE REPLIT IF YOU HAVE MACOS. IF YOU ALREADY HAVE PYTHON ON MACOS, THEN YOU CAN USE THIS METHOD!*
Go to https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.7/python-3.9.7-amd64.exe and python should install automatically. Then, once its done installing, click it and run the installer.
# Step 2
Find the hack file in here in your file explorer or in google chrome if you still have it in the downloads bar. Then, run it.
# Step 3
Follow the text on the screen and insert the amounts of each thing you want, then once its generated, copy the code INSIDE THE QUOTES.(Quick Tip: I believe that CTRL + C doesnt work) Do NOT copy the b' or the closing ', you'll see what I mean when you run it. Then, insert the code into the game. If you click the settings icon in the top right corner of the game, then click import, it will pop up an alert telling you to paste the code into there.

# Step 4
If you have existing progress that you want to save, then go to the settings menu, and click export. Then, you copy the code in the pop up box that shows up on your screen. Paste it onto a saving text editor online or write it down somewhere, doesn't matter which. I recommend https://protectedtext.com, where you can make text protected behind a password encrypt, although having a password wouldn't matter because you can't do much with a save code anyways.

# For additional questions
I would put my Discord here but it got termed and I need to verify my phone number. I put my phone number onto the account that got banned so I can't use it, if y'all can do anything about it, email me at gagekot@gmail.com. It'll probably take a while for me to see, but whatever. You can also create an issue, if it's an issue.
